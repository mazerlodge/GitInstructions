== Workflow - initial use of a folder w/ Git ==

# prerequisite: A git repo on github
mkdir IntegrationTest

git init 
# creates a .git folder with git goo inside

git remote add origin <url>
# tells git this folder is bolted to <url>

git pull origin master
# get the master branch of the repo

git checkout -b amend-my-name
# create a branch 

git branch -a  
# view all branches.

# now modify a pulled file, for example README.md

git add README.md  
# tells git you changed this file, it is now STAGED

git commit -a
# this option allows setting the comment vi editor for all modified files

git push origin master
~OR~
git push --set-upstream origin amend-my-name
# this ships changes up to the server.
# the second form also establishes the branch if it is new.
# note if you omit the name in the first form it pushes the current working branch.

# Merging branches
(on branch development)$ git merge master
(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)
git checkout master
git merge development (there won't be any conflicts now)

# now invent a new file.

git add LexicalScoping.R
# tell git to index the new file

git commit -m 'A quick example' LexicalScoping.R
# stage the new file

git push origin master
# actually send the file to the server

# now go play with Milestones and Issues
