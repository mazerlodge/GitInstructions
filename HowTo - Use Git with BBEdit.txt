HowTo - Use Git with BBEdit 

Check if folder is up to date (equiv to $git status)
	GitMenu -> Show Working Copy Status...
	
	Result: 
		If all is current a dialog saying working copy is clean. 
		If differences, a find results window opens showing changed and/or added files
	
Add a new file to source control (equiv to $git add) 
	Two options (maybe more): 
		With file active, GitMenu -> Add 
		From result of "Show Working Copy Status...", select file in notes list 
			right-click menu -> Add 
		
		Note: BBEdit provides no feedback to either of these techniques. 
			To confirm add worked, refresh "Show Working Copy Status..." results window.

Remove an added file (before Commit) 
	Can try "Show Working Copy Status...", right-click menu -> Remove, but if git log appears
		Command line $git rm --cached <filename>
			
Commit, all staged or single file (equiv to $git commit)
	For a single file, have file active then GitMenu -> Commit... 
	For multiple, GitMenu -> Commit Staged Changes...
