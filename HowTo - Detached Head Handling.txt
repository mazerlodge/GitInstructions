Detatched Head means the current checkout isn't the head of all commits.  It's a normal state. 

$ git log --oneline 
Observe where head is pointing. 

TL;DR the reference? 
Scenario #1: I’m Here by Accident
	$git checkout <branch-name>
	-or-
	$git switch <branch-name>

Scenario #2: I’ve Made Experimental Changes and I Want to Discard Them
	Same as scenario #1, just switch branches and go about your business 

	Note: Git may warn you about this being a good time to create a branch 

Scenario #3: I’ve Made Experimental Changes and I Want to Keep Them
	If you want to keep changes made with a detached HEAD, just create a new branch and switch to it.

	$git branch alt-history
	$git checkout alt-history

	OK, that's cool but I want to get this stuff on master or origin. 
	{after the steps above, creating a branch}
	$git checkout master
	$git merge alt-history
