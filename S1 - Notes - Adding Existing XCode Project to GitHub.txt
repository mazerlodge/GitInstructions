S1 - Notes - Adding Existing XCode Project to GitHub

Steps to add an existing XCode project to GitHub. 

Note: If XCode is used to create the project, the .xcodeproject directly will be exposed through GitHub.
These steps prevent that.

Prep
- Zip project before starting, just in case.

Create a repository on GitHub
- (for WSC projects) Check for the current max Weekly Source Code number 
- To keep things simple use the name of the existing XCode project
- (for WSC projects) Set description (e.g. "Weekly Source Code #2018xx")
- Check box to "Initialize the project with a README" (ignore the message 'skip this step...')
- Select .gitignore for language of the project (e.g. Objective-C) 
- Click create repository.
- (for WSC projects) Add topic tag 'weeklysourcecode'.
- Edit .gitignore, add the following:
	# XCode project file
	*.xcodeproj
	.DS_Store 
	
- Save change w/ comment "Added XCode project file to ignored list" 

Move local code out of the way
- Close project if it is open in XCode
- Rename existing project to "{name}_Local" 
- Open XCode, no project, choose SourceControl -> Clone
- Select newly created GitHub repository, click the "Clone" button
- Select the appropriate local folder for source (e.g. XProjects/{language}) 
- Note, XCode will open the newly created folder, covering up the 'clone projects' dialog
- Close the XCode 'clone projects' dialog (may be in the background) 

Move local files into newly created 'clone' folder
- Open additional finder window (cmd-click on XProjects, then navigate to {proj}_Local folder)
- Copy Project, source, etc. folders to new 'cloned' folder
- DO NOT Overwrite the .gitignore pulled from the server (if you do, just revert to the server version) 
- Delete _Local folder.

Update local files before pushing to server
- Open XCode project now in 'cloned' folder.
- Add README.md file to XCode project, deselect target for build.
- Do Global Search/Replace to replace full name in source comments with github user name. 
- Do Global Search/Replace to replace scarypenguin.com in comments with github user name.
- Add project description to README.md
- Verify there are no stray source files in folder that are not in project. 

Add local files to source control
- Select Source Control -> Commit...
- Select Source folder (and any other files desired) 

Update server with local source files.
- Select Source Control -> Push...
